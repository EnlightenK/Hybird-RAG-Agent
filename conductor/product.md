# Initial Concept
An agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combining MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with Pydantic AI for intelligent document retrieval, featuring hybrid search and multi-format ingestion.

# Target Users
- Developers looking for a template to build RAG applications with MongoDB.
- Organizations seeking to implement intelligent search over their document repositories.
- AI Engineers interested in manual Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) implementations on MongoDB Atlas M0 tier.

# Goals
- Provide a robust, scalable RAG architecture using MongoDB Atlas.
- Demonstrate hybrid search capabilities (Vector + Full-text).
- Support multi-format document ingestion using Docling.
- Offer a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the knowledge base.

# Key Features
- Hybrid Search (Vector Search + Full-text Search with RRF).
- Multi-format document ingestion (PDF, Word, Audio, etc.).
- Intelligent chunking with Docling.
- Conversational CLI with streaming responses.
- Cost-effective operation on MongoDB Atlas Free Tier.
